# Pomodoro app

In this project, I built out a Pomodoro timer app using HTML, Javascript, CSS, and mainly jQuery.

Users should be able to:

- Set a pomodoro timer and short & long break timers
- Customize how long each timer runs for
- See a circular progress bar that updates every minute and represents how far through their timer they are
- Customize the appearance of the app with the ability to set preferences for colors and fonts
- Previous setting values are applied to the app after refreshing
